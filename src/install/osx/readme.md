deepstream is available via brew cask.

The only dependency you need is to install Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. If you don't already have it installed, you can install it via:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

To install deepstream, simply run the command into your terminal

```bash
brew cask install deepstream
```

Resulting in

```bash
$ cd ~
$ cp /usr/local/etc/deepstream .
$ ls
config.yml  permissions.yml  users.yml
$ deepstream start -c config.yml
```
